Sorting Visualizer
A web-based Sorting Visualizer that demonstrates popular sorting algorithms with interactive visualization. Users can generate random arrays, select sorting algorithms, and adjust speed and array size for a better understanding of how each algorithm works.

Features
Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Custom Controls:
Generate new random arrays
Adjust array size (Small/Large)
Control sorting speed (Slow/Fast)

Project Structure
HTML: index.html
Handles the structure of the interface, including buttons, radio inputs, and the visual area for the sorting bars.

CSS: index.css
Provides styling for the layout, buttons, and the bars, giving the visualizer a sleek and responsive design.

JavaScript: index.js
Implements all sorting algorithms, interaction logic, and controls for generating arrays, adjusting speed, and performing sorting operations.

How to Run
Clone or download the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
cd sorting-visualizer
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Usage
Click "Generate New Array" to create a random array.
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown.
Adjust the speed and array size using the radio buttons.
Press the "Sort" button to start the sorting process.
Sorting Algorithms Explained
Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing and placing elements in the correct position.
Selection Sort: Finds the smallest element in the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element.
Merge Sort: Recursively splits the array into halves and merges them back in sorted order.
Quick Sort: Divides the array around a pivot and sorts each part recursively.
Heap Sort: Turns the array into a heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
Controls
Array Size:

Small: Fewer elements for a simpler view
Large: More elements for a detailed view
Sorting Speed:

Slow: Easier to follow the process
Fast: Quicker execution
